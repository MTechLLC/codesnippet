Code Snippet

This plugin lets you insert rich code snippets with syntax highlighting into the editor.

The default implementation uses the integrated highlight.js library, but the plugin can be easily customized to use a different syntax highlighter, including a server-side one. An example of such implementation is the Code Snippet GeSHi plugin that is an extension of this plugin.
